    "### Understanding Workflows in Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "An AI agent is powered by a large language model (LLM) and can access various tools to accomplish tasks. Its behavior is dynamic - the steps it takes are determined by the LLM based on the context of the conversation and the instructions provided. Agents are great for handling open-ended tasks where flexibility and reasoning are key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflows**\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow is a predefined sequence of operations designed to handle more structured processes. It can include AI agents as components, along with human-in-the-loop steps and integrations with external systems. Unlike an agent’s dynamic decision-making, a workflow’s execution path is explicitly defined, giving you greater control and predictability. Workflows are ideal for orchestrating complex business processes that require coordination across multiple agents and systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Strong typing ensures messages flow correctly between components, with comprehensive validation that prevents runtime errors.\n",
    "- **Flexible Control Flow**: Graph-based architecture allows for intuitive modeling of complex workflows with `executors` and `edges`. Conditional routing, parallel processing, and dynamic execution paths are all supported.\n",
    "- **External Integration**: Built-in request/response patterns for seamless integration with external APIs, and human-in-the-loop scenarios.\n",
    "- **Checkpointing**: Save workflow states via checkpoints, enabling recovery and resumption of long-running processes on server sides.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Built-in patterns for coordinating multiple AI agents, including sequential, concurrent, hand-off, and magentic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "1. **Executors**: represent individual processing units within a workflow. They can be AI agents or custom logic components. They receive input messages, perform specific tasks, and produce output messages.\n",
    "2. **Edges**: define the connections between executors, determining the flow of messages. They can include conditions to control routing based on message contents.\n",
    "3. **Workflows**: are directed graphs composed of executors and edges. They define the overall process, starting from an initial executor and proceeding through various paths based on conditions and logic defined in the edges."

    "### Agents in a Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "To add intelligence to your workflows, you can use AI agents as part of your workflow execution. AI agents can be easily integrated into workflows, allowing you to create complex, intelligent solutions that were previously difficult to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What happens when you add an agent to a workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add an agent to a workflow in the Agent Framework (see example below), you’re essentially wrapping the agent inside a workflow executor so it can participate in the workflow orchestration. The executor is the one handling the communication of the agent with other workflow parts.\n",
    "1. Whenever the executor receives a single or a list of chat messages, it will trigger the agent to respond with the response type of `AgentExecutorResponse` object. The class contains the following information about agent's response:\n",
    "    - `executor_id` - the ID of the executor that produced the response\n",
    "    - `agent_run_response` - the full response from the agent\n",
    "    - `full_conversation` - the full conversation history up to this point\n",
    "2. There are two possible event types related to agent responses that can be emitted:\n",
    "    - `AgentRunUpdateEvent` - chunks of agent's responses as they are generated (streaming)\n",
    "    - `AgentRunEvent` - full response from the agent (non-streaming)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, agents are wrapped in executors that run in streaming mode. You can customize this behavior by creating a custom executor. With custom executors, you can control invocation of the agent, message types it will handle, agent life cycle and other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more on how to [create a Custom Agent Executor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/using-agents?pivots=programming-language-python).\n",
