    "## Agent Framework Workflows Orchestrations\n",
    "Traditional single-agent systems are limited in their ability to handle complex, multi-faceted tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent orchestration addresses this limitation by allowing you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assign distinct skills, responsibilities, or perspectives to each agent.\n",
    "- Combine outputs from multiple agents to improve decision-making and accuracy.\n",
    "- Coordinate steps in a workflow so each agent’s work builds on the last.\n",
    "- Dynamically route control between agents based on context or rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orchestrations** are pre-built workflow patterns that allow developers to quickly create complex workflows by simply plugging in their own AI agents. Instead of manually wiring every edge, you can use these patterns to define how agents interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all patterns share the same core interface, you can easily experiment with different orchestration strategies without rewriting agent logic or learning new APIs. The SDK abstracts the complexity of agent communication, coordination, and result aggregation so you can focus on designing workflows that deliver results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Framework provides four orchestration patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential** - Agents execute one after another in a defined order, ideal for linear processing\n",
    "2. **Concurrent** - Broadcast the same task to multiple agents at once and collect results independently.\n",
    "3. **Handoff** - Control is dynamically transferred from one agent to another based on context or role.\n",
    "4. **Group chat** - Coordinate a shared conversation among multiple agents managed by a chat manager that decides who speaks next and when to stop.\n",
    "4. **Magentic** - Manager-driven approach where agents dynamically pull tasks based on the evolving context, task progress, and agent capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Agent Framework documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/orchestrations/overview) to learn more about these orchestration types and check out the [Agent Framework repo](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started/workflows/orchestration) to see more advanced orchestration types in action.\n",

    "### Example of Sequential Orchestration\n",
    "In sequential orchestration, agents are organized in a pipeline. Each agent processes the task in turn, passing its output to the next agent in the sequence. This is ideal for workflows where each step builds upon the previous one, such as document review, data processing pipelines, or multi-stage reasoning.\n",

    "## Group Chat Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group chat orchestration** models a collaborative conversation among multiple AI agents and optionally a human participant. A central chat manager controls the flow and decides which agent responds next or when to request human input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group chat is ideal for iterative refinement, debate, and multi‑perspective problem solving where agents share the same conversation context and can build on each other’s outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core parts of Group chat orchestration:**\n",
    "1. **Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual ChatAgents with distinct roles (e.g., Planner, Engineer, Reviewer). Each agent can reason independently but collaborates through the orchestrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `GroupChatBuilder()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluent API to assemble a group chat with participants, speaker selection strategy or a prompt‑based manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `GroupChatStateSnapshot`\n",
    "    - Immutable snapshot that contains the following:\n",
    "        - task: `ChatMessage` - original user task\n",
    "        - participants: `dict[str, str]` - participant names → descriptions\n",
    "        - conversation: `tuple[ChatMessage, ...]` - full conversation history\n",
    "        - history: `tuple[GroupChatTurn, ...]` - turn-by-turn with speaker attribution\n",
    "        - round_index: `int` - number of selection rounds so far\n",
    "        - pending_agent: `str | None` - currently active agent (if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this information to define a custom selection logic and implement guardrails.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Selection Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy that decides who speaks next each turn. You can choose between deterministic code‑based selection or use the default AI‑managed selection. The latter uses the default group chat orchestration pipeline shared with Magentic, so you benefit from established patterns for iterative collaboration and stopping criteria without writing orchestration glue.\n",
